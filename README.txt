# FactorialPowerPlan SAS Macro

## Overview

The `%FactorialPowerPlan` macro can be used to do sample size and power calculations for planning either a factorial or fractional factorial experiment. The calculations can be done for either posttest-only or pretest-posttest designs. Participants can either be assumed to be independent, or nested within existing clusters as discussed in Dziak, Nahum-Shani, and Collins (2012).

The macro can be used for three separate purposes:

- to calculate statistical power based on an available sample size and assumed effect size,
- to calculate required sample size based on a desired statistical power and an assumed effect size, or
- to calculate minimum detectable effect size based on available sample size and desired statistical power.
